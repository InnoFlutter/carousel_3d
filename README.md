## Getting started

1. Add package to pubspec.yaml
```carousel_widget_3d: 1.0.0```

2. Import it to file where it is going to be used

3. Create Carousel3d widget and provide required attributes

```dart
Carousel3d(
          center: _center,
          items: [
          <items to display>
          ],
        )
```
Where center is a state that controls which element is central in carousel.
By changing center the carousel is rotated so that any event can be associated with carousel rotation

## Usage

Display 5 different images in carousel

```dart
Carousel3d(
          center: _center,
          items: [
            Image.assets('assets/img_1.png'),
                      Image.asset('assets/img_2.png'),
                      Image.asset('assets/img_3.png'),
                      Image.asset('assets/img_4.png'),
                      Image.asset('assets/img_5.png'),
